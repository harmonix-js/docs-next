## What is Harmonix ?

Harmonix is a free and open-source framework that features an intuitive and easy-to-use API, designed to streamline the development of Discord bots.

We've simplified everything to enable you to start writing commands and events immediately, without the need to concern yourself with the underlying structure of your bot.

## Features

Harmonix uses standard conventions and an organized directory structure to automate routine tasks, allowing developers to focus on feature development. However, the configuration file can be customized to modify the default settings.

- hello
- nuxt
- content

## Architecture

Harmonix is built on top of the Discord.js library, which provides a powerful and flexible API for interacting with the Discord API. Additionally, Harmonix includes several essential packages:

```javascript [file.js]{4-6,7} icon=typescript-icon
export default () => {
  console.log('Code block')
}
```
