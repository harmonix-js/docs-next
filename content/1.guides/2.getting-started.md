title: Getting started
---

Before creating a new application, you should ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Harmonix needs `Node.js >= 18.0`.

```bash
node -v
# v18.0.0
```

## Creating a new bot

You may create a new project using npm init. These commands will download the create-adonisjs initializer package and begin the installation process.

You may customize the initial project output using one of the following CLI flags.

```bash
npm init harmonix@latest my-app
```

## Starting the development

Once you have created an Harmonix application, you may start the bot in development mode by runnin÷¥g the `npm run dev` command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

In development mode, the bot will automatically restart when you make changes to the source code.

## Building for production

Since Harmonix applications are written in TypeScript, they must be compiled into JavaScript before running in production.

You may create the JavaScript output using the `npm run build` command. The JavaScript output is written to the `build` directory.

```bash
npm run build
```
