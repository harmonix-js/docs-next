title: Commands
---

Harmonix automatically loads and executes command handlers when a command is received. Command handlers are defined in separate files, making it easier to manage and organize your bot's codebase.

## Handling commands

Commands are sent by users to interact with the bot. The command name is derived from the file name, so `ping.ts` will handle the `ping` command.

```bash [Directory structure]
| commands/
--| ping.ts
```

```ts [commands/ping.ts] icon=typescript-icon
export default defineCommand(
  {
    description: 'Replies with Pong!'
  },
  async (interaction) => {
    await interaction.reply('Pong!')
  }
)
```

## Custom commands directory

If you want to change the folder where the commands are stored, you can do so by modifying the `dirs.commands` property in the configuration file.

```ts [harmonix.config.ts] icon=typescript-icon
export default defineHarmonixConfig({
  dirs: {
    commands: 'actions'
  }
})
```

## Accessing command options

Commands can have options that are used to provide additional information to the command. Options can be defined in the command handler.

```ts [commands/greetUser.ts] icon=typescript-icon
export default defineCommand(
  {
    description: 'Greets a user',
    options: {
      user: {
        type: 'User',
        description: 'The user to greet'
      }
    }
  },
  async (interaction, context) => {
    const { user } = context.options

    await interaction.reply(`Hello, ${user?.username}!`)
  }
)
```

Each command handler receives `interaction` and `context` objects as an argument. The `interaction` object contains information about the command interaction, while the `context` object contains the command options.

## Categorizing commands

Commands can be categorized by creating subdirectories in the `commands` directory. The subdirectory name is used as the category name.

```bash [Directory structure]
| commands/
--| general/
----| ping.ts
--| moderation/
----| kick.ts
```

Or if you want to categorize commands using the `category` property in the command handler configuration.

```ts [commands/ping.ts] icon=typescript-icon
export default defineCommand(
  {
    description: 'Replies with Pong!',
    category: 'general'
  },
  async (client, interaction) => {
    await interaction.reply('Pong!')
  }
)
```
