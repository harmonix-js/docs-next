The easiest way to get started with Harmonix is by using the `@harmonix-js/cli` tool. This command-line interface allows you to quickly set up a new Harmonix bot with all necessary configurations.

You can create a new project interactively by running:

```bash [Terminal] icon=ph:terminal
npx @harmonix-js/cli@latest init <my-bot>
```

```bash [Terminal] icon=ph:terminal
pnpm dlx @harmonix-js/cli@latest init <my-bot>
```

```bash [Terminal] icon=ph:terminal
yarn dlx @harmonix-js/cli@latest init <my-bot>
```

During the setup, you will be prompted to provide the following information:

```txt icon=ph:terminal,numbered
What is the name of your project?
Wich package manager would you like to use? npm / pnpm / yarn
Initialize git repository? Yes / No
```

After completing the prompts, `@harmonix-js/cli` will create a project folder with your chosen name and install all necessary dependencies.
