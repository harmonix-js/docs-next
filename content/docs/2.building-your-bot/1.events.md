title: Event Handling
---

The event handling system in Harmonix allows you to listen for and respond to various events that occur in your bot. Events are triggered by Discord and can be used to perform actions.

## Definition

An event is defined within files in the `events` directory. The event handler is defined using the `defineEvent` function.

```ts [events/ready.ts] icon=bxl:typescript,numbered
export default defineEvent((client) => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user?.tag}!`)
})
```

The name of the file is the name of the event that it handles. The event name is derived from the file name, so `ready.ts` will handle the `ready` event.

You can see the full list of events in the [Discord documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway-events#receive-events){:target="\_blank"}.

## Handler arguments

By default, event handler arguments are of type `any`. To access event-specific arguments, you must define the event type as a type argument in the `defineEvent` function.

```ts [events/ready.ts] icon=bxl:typescript,numbered
export default defineEvent<'ready'>((client) => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user?.tag}!`)
})
```

By specifying `ready` as the type argument, the handler function understands that it is dealing with the `ready` event. Consequently, it can correctly resolve the types of the arguments passed to it.

## On-time event

If a handler should only be executed once, you can add the `.once` suffix to the file name.
Or you can set the `once` property to `true` in the event handler configuration.

```ts [events/guildMemberAdd.ts] icon=bxl:typescript,numbered
export default defineEvent<'guildMemberAdd'>(
  {
    once: true
  },
  (member) => {
    console.log(`New member joined: ${member.displayName}`)
  }
)
```

::tip

The `ready` event is automatically set to `once: true` and does not need to be explicitly defined.
