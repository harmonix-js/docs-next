title: Building Your Bot
---

Harmonix provides the building blocks to create flexible and powerful bots. The guides in Building Your Bot explain how to use these features and how to customize your bot's behavior.

The sections and pages are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your Harmonix bot. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

If you're new to Discord bot development, we recommend starting with the [Event](/), [Command](/) and [Context menu](/) sections, as they introduce the fundamental Discord bot concepts to help you get started. Then, you can dive deeper into the other sections such as [Buttons](/), [Modals](/), and [Select menus](/). Finally, once you're ready, checkout the [Deploying](/) and [Upgrading](/) sections.
