title: Preconditon
---

Precondition allows you to run a command only if a certain condition is met. This can be useful for checking permissions, roles, or other conditions before executing a command.

## Definition

Preconditions are defined in the `preconditions` directory in the root of the project. The file name will be used as the precondition id, so `admin.ts` will handle the `admin` precondition.

```ts [preconditions/admin.ts] icon=bxl:typescript,numbered
export default definePrecondition(async (interaction) => {
  if (interaction.memberPermissions?.has('Administrator')) {
    return true
  }

  await interaction.reply('You do not have permission to run this command!')
  return false
})
```

::tip

Note that the precondition function must return a boolean value. If the condition is met, the function should return `true`. If the condition is not met, the function should return `false`.

## Usage

Preconditions can be used in commands to check if a user meets the required conditions to run the command, by adding the `preconditions` property to the command configuration.

```ts [commands/ban.ts] icon=bxl:typescript,numbered
export default defineCommand(
  {
    description: 'Ban a user from the server',
    options: {
      user: {
        type: 'User',
        description: 'The user to ban'
      },
      reason: {
        type: 'String',
        description: 'The reason for the ban',
        required: false
      }
    },
    preconditions: ['admin']
  },
  async (interaction, context) => {
    const { user, reason } = context.options

    await interaction.guild?.members.ban(user)
    await interaction.reply(`Banned ${user.tag} for ${reason}`)
  }
)
```

::tip

You can also use the `userPermissions` property in the command configuration, to handle natively if the user has the required permissions to run the command.
