Harmonix groups Discord features such as buttons, modals and select menus into a single category. These are the components.

## Buttons

A button is an interactive component that can be added to messages to allow users to interact with the bot. Buttons can be used to trigger actions, send messages, or open URLs.

### Definition

Buttons are defined in the `components/buttons` directory. The button id is derived from the file name, so `like.ts` will handle the `like` button.

```ts [components/buttons/like.ts] icon=bxl:typescript,numbered
export default defineButton(
  {
    label: 'Like',
    style: 'Primary'
  },
  async (interaction) => {
    await interaction.reply('You liked the message!')
  }
)
```

### Usage

Buttons can be used in commands or events. To use a button in a command, you can use the `useButtons` function to get the buttons.

```ts [commands/sendMessage.ts] icon=bxl:typescript,numbered
export default defineCommand(
  {
    description: 'Sends a message with a like button'
  },
  async (client, interaction) => {
    const { like } = useButtons()
    const row = useActionRow(like)

    await interaction.reply('Click the like button!', { components: [row] })
  }
)
```

## Modals

A modal is a dialog that can be used to collect information from users. Modals can be used to display forms, confirmations, or other types of user input.

### Definition

Modals are defined in the `components/modals` directory. The modal id is derived from the file name, so `confirm.ts` will handle the `confirm` modal.

```ts [components/modals/confirm.ts] icon=bxl:typescript,numbered
export default defineModal(
  {
    title: 'Confirm action',
    description: 'Are you sure you want to delete this message?'
  },
  async (interaction) => {
    await interaction.reply('You confirmed the action!')
  }
)
```

### Usage

Modals can be used in commands or events. To use a modal in a command, you can use the `useModals` function to get the modals.

```ts [commands/sendMessage.ts] icon=bxl:typescript,numbered
export default defineCommand(
  {
    description: 'Sends a message with a like button'
  },
  async (interaction) => {
    const { confirm } = useModals()

    await interaction.showModal(confirm)
  }
)
```

## Select Menus

A select menu is an interactive component that can be used to provide users with a list of options to choose from. Select menus can be used to create dropdowns, multiple-choice questions, or other types of user input.

### Definition

Select menus are defined in the `components/select-menus` directory. The select menu id is derived from the file name, so `colors.ts` will handle the `colors` select menu.

```ts [components/select-menus/colors.ts] icon=bxl:typescript,numbered
export default defineSelectMenu(
  {
    placeholder: 'Select a color',
    options: [
      {
        label: 'Red',
        value: 'red'
      },
      {
        label: 'Green',
        value: 'green'
      },
      {
        label: 'Blue',
        value: 'blue'
      }
    ]
  },
  async (interaction) => {
    await interaction.reply('You selected a color!')
  }
)
```

### Usage

Select menus can be used in commands or events. To use a select menu in a command, you can use the `useSelectMenus` function to get the select menus.

```ts [commands/sendMessage.ts] icon=bxl:typescript,numbered
export default defineCommand(
  {
    description: 'Sends a message with a select menu'
  },
  async (interaction) => {
    const { colors } = useSelectMenus()
    const row = useActionRow(colors)

    await interaction.reply('Select a color!', { components: [row] })
  }
)
```
