Modals are interactive components that can be used to display information, receive input, or confirm actions. Modals can be used to create custom dialogs, forms, or alerts.

## Handling modal interactions

Modals are triggered by users to interact with the bot. The modal id is derived from the file name, so `confirm.ts` will handle the `confirm` modal.

```bash [Directory structure]
| modals/
--| confirm.ts
```

```ts [modals/confirm.ts] icon=typescript-icon
export default defineModal(
  {
    title: 'Confirm action',
    description: 'Are you sure you want to delete this message?'
  },
  async (interaction) => {
    await interaction.reply('You confirmed the action!')
  }
)
```

Each modal handler receive `interaction` object as an argument. The `interaction` object contains information about the button interaction.

## Custom modals directory

If you want to change the folder where the modals are stored, you can do so by modifying the `dirs.modals` property in the configuration file.

```ts [harmonix.config.ts] icon=typescript-icon
export default defineHarmonixConfig({
  dirs: {
    modals: 'dialogs'
  }
})
```

## Use modals everywhere

Modals can be used in commands, events, and context menus to provide interactive functionality to users. To use a modal in a command, you can use the `useModals` function to get the modals.

```ts [commands/sendMessage.ts] icon=typescript-icon
export default defineCommand(
  {
    description: 'Sends a message with a like button'
  },
  async (client, interaction) => {
    const { confirm } = useModals()

    await interaction.showModal(confirm)
  }
)
```
